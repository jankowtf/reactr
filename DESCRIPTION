Description: The package facilitates the specification of reactive objects
        based on reactive expressions that dynamically bind them to other
        objects. That way, an object 'x' can be dynamically observed by 'n'
        other objects. Whenever 'x' changes, the 'n' variables observing
        'x' change according to their reactive expressions that defines the
        actual binding relationship. Two different reactivity are provided:
        one builds on top of functionality from the shiny package, the
        other is an alternative implementation that reveals a lot of the
        details that shiny solves in a similar, yet much more elegantly
        way.
