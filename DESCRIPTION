Description: The package facilitates the specification of reactive objects based on
         reactive expressions that dynamically bind them to other objects. That way,
         an object 'x' can be dynamically observed by 'n' other objects. Whenever 'x'
         changes, the 'n' variables observing 'x' change according to their reactive
         expressions that defines the actual binding relationship. Two different
         reactivity are provided: one builds on top of functionality from the shiny
         package, the other is an alternative implementation that reveals a lot of
         the details that shiny solves in a similar, yet much more elegantly way.
